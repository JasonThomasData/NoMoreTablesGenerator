#No More Tables generator

Takes data from Excel or html tables (cut and paste) and creates a responsive table, based on the No More Tables CSS hack.

Allows you to set a breakpoint for the table.
If the device screen is smaller, the table folds under itself.

Currently uses SBS style sheets, but you can replace those obviously.
I have not had time to make a PHP script to save the html file to the '''tables''' folder, so you'll need to paste it there manually.

I will add more features, like the ability to pick an element and give it custom styles, using macros (all elements like this) and targeting elements specifically.
